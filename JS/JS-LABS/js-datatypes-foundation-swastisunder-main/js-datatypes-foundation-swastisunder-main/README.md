# JavaScript Data Types Foundation Lab

Master JavaScript built-in methods through **12 desi, story-based challenges**! From Guddu ki chai tapri to a Thali combo platter, each problem puts you in a real Indian scenario where you need to use built-in methods of String, Number, Array, and Object to get things done.

**Total: 100 points across 12 challenges**

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Accept the assignment

Click the GitHub Classroom invitation link shared by your instructor. This will create a **personal copy** of this repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone your repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd js-datatypes-foundation-lab
```

Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the URL from your GitHub Classroom repo (the green **Code** button).

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Verify everything works

```bash
npm test
```

You should see **all tests failing** — that's expected! Your job is to make them pass.

## How to Solve the Challenges

### Step 1 — Open a challenge file

All challenges live in the `src/` folder. Start with `src/01-chai-order.js` and work your way up.

```
src/
├── 01-chai-order.js             ← Start here
├── 02-rangoli-maker.js
├── 03-rickshaw-meter.js
├── 04-sabzi-mandi.js
├── 05-train-coach.js
├── 06-kiryana-store.js
├── 07-ration-card.js
├── 08-paan-shop.js
├── 09-postcard-writer.js
├── 10-pincode-checker.js
├── 11-parcel-service.js
└── 12-thali-combo.js
```

### Step 2 — Read the kahani and rules

Each file has a detailed JSDoc comment at the top that explains:
- The **kahani** (story — a real Indian scenario)
- The **rules** your function must follow
- The **parameters** and **return values**

Read it carefully — every edge case and requirement is described there.

### Step 3 — Write your solution

Replace `// Your code here` with your implementation:

```js
// Before
export function getChaiOrderLength(order) {
  // Your code here
}

// After (example)
export function getChaiOrderLength(order) {
  if (typeof order !== "string") return -1;
  return order.trim().length;
}
```

### Step 4 — Run the test for that challenge

```bash
npm test -- 01-chai
```

You can use any part of the filename to match:

```bash
npm test -- 02-rangoli
npm test -- 03-rickshaw
npm test -- sabzi
npm test -- train-coach
npm test -- kiryana
```

### Step 5 — Fix and repeat

If tests fail, read the error messages — they tell you exactly what was expected vs. what your function returned. Fix your code and run the test again.

### Step 6 — Move to the next challenge

Once all tests pass for a challenge, move on to the next one. They get progressively harder.

### Run all tests at once

```bash
npm test
```

### Watch mode (auto re-run on save)

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

This re-runs tests every time you save a file — very handy while working.

## Submitting Your Work

### 1. Check your progress

Run all tests to see how many you've solved:

```bash
npm test
```

### 2. Stage your changes

```bash
git add src/
```

> **Important:** Only add files from `src/`. Do not modify or commit test files.

### 3. Commit your work

```bash
git commit -m "Complete datatypes foundation lab"
```

You can commit as many times as you want — each push triggers a new grading run.

### 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 5. Check your grade

After pushing, go to your repository on GitHub:

1. Click the **Actions** tab
2. You'll see a workflow run in progress (or completed)
3. Click on it to see which tests passed and your total score out of 100

You can push again to improve your score — GitHub Classroom will always use the latest result.

## Windows Users

If you are on Windows and `npm test` fails, use the Windows-specific scripts instead:

```bash
npm run test:win
```

For watch mode on Windows:

```bash
npm run test:win:watch
```

## Tips for Success

- **JSDoc dhyan se padho** — every rule and edge case is described there
- **Try methods in the console first** — open Node REPL (`node`) or browser console and experiment with `"hello".toUpperCase()`, `[1,2,3].map(x => x*2)`, etc. before writing your solution
- **MDN Docs are your best friend** — search "MDN String toUpperCase" or "MDN Array reduce" for detailed explanations and examples
- **Return types matter** — check the exact shape of what each function should return (string, number, array, object, or null)
- **Edge cases handle karo** — wrong types, empty strings, empty arrays — the JSDoc tells you what to return for each
- **Use `console.log()`** — add temporary logs to debug, then remove them before submitting
- **Don't modify the test files** — only edit files in `src/`
- **Commit often** — don't wait until you've solved everything to push

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm test` shows "command not found" | Run `npm install` first |
| All tests fail with `undefined` | You haven't written your solution yet — that's expected |
| Tests say "expected X but received Y" | Your logic is close but not matching the rules — re-read the JSDoc |
| `git push` is rejected | Run `git pull origin main` first, then push again |
| Tests pass locally but fail on GitHub | Make sure you pushed all your changes (`git status` to check) |
| `npm test` fails on Windows | Use `npm run test:win` instead |

Good luck! Aur haan, methods sikhte sikhte chai aur samosa lena mat bhoolna!
